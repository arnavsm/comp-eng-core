Assignment 8 - Intermediate Code Generation

The description of source language operators are given as follows

 Operators           Precedence  Associativity
-----------------------------------------------
  Parenthesis ()        Highest  Left to right
  Unary minus (-)                Right to left
  * / %                          Left to right
   + -                           Left to right
    =                  Lowest    Right to left
Identifiers A-Z are single length strings represent variables stored in memory.
Temporary t1,t2,...  are temporary variables in three-address intermediate code.

Write a program to generate three-address code for a given algebraic expression following the 
given information.

Sample input: A – B + C / D / E

Output
t1=A–B
t2=C/D
t3=t2/E
t4=t1+t3
