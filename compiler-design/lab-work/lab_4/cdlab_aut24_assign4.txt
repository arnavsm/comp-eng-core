Assignment 4
Use FLEX to design the following

1. A DFA that recognises chemical formulas 
coposed of  the eigth elements H, C, N, O, 
SI, S, CL, and SN. The formula is written 
with commas separating consecutive elements 
and an element can appear in any order, 
in any combination. There are nine input 
symbols: CHILONS, d where d stands for digit. 
Sample sequqnces are of the form: H2,O O,H7 O2 
etc. The formulas need not represent compounds
 that actually exist.

2. A lexical analyzer for MORSE CODE. 
The inputs are dot, dash and space. 
The outputs are tokens for all the 
alphanumerics and punctuation marks for 
which there are codes. 
Refer the Morse Code table.
