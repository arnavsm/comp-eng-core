                               Assignnment 2 - From Regular expression to DFA            

Write programs for automatic construction of DFA from a given regular expression (RE) using following 
methods 
1. RE (i/p) -> NFA -> DFA -> DFA with minimum states (final o/p),
2. RE (i/p) -> augmented RE -> DFA (final o/p).
Verify the number of states in DFA produced by method 2 is minimum. Find the time and space required 
each method. Consider the regular expression (a|b)*abb as a sample input.

For decomposition and syntax trees convert input RE to its postfix equivalent then evaluate them.
For method 1: (a|b)*.a.b.b -> ab|*ab.b. 
For method 2: (a|b)*.a.b.b -> (a|b)*.a.b.b.# -> ab|*ab.b.#.
